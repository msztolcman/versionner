versionner
==========

``versionner`` helps manipulating version of the project.

With one command you can update all required files and git with new
version.

If you like this tool, just `say
thanks <https://saythanks.io/to/msztolcman>`__.

Current stable version
----------------------

1.4.1

Features
--------

-  ``versionner`` guards the compliance with `Semantic
   Versioning <http://semver.org/>`__
-  manual changes are error-prone, ``versionner`` is error proof
-  it's easier to write: ``ver up`` instead of open editor, edit and
   save changes ;)
-  ``versionner`` updates also project files (like README or sth)
-  and create vcs (only git currently) tag if requested
-  it's `very easy to install <#installation>`__
-  and it's all in one command...

Python version
--------------

``versionner`` works only with Python 3.3+. Older Python versions are
unsupported.

Some examples
-------------

Some examples:

::

    # initialize new file with version 0.1.0
    % ver init

    # initialize new file with version 1.0.0
    % ver init 1.0.0

    # prints current version info
    % ver

    # increase minor by 1, set patch to 0
    % ver up

    # increase patch by 1
    % ver up --patch

    # increase patch by 2 and try to automatically commit changes
    % ver up --patch -c

    # create git tag
    % ver tag

    # increase patch by 4
    % ver up --patch 4
     
    # just guess...
    % ver set --minor 3 --patch 2 --build asd3f
        
    # set version to 1.0.0
    % ver set 1.0.0

    # create signed VCS tag
    % ver tag --vcs-param -s

More
----

Everything is in help :) Just execute:

::

    ver --help

Look at result:

::

    % ver --help
    usage: ver [-h] [--file VERSION_FILE] [--version] [--date-format DATE_FORMAT]
               [--vcs-engine VCS_ENGINE] [--vcs-commit-message VCS_COMMIT_MESSAGE]
               [--verbose]
               {init,up,set,tag} ...

    Helps manipulating version of the project

    positional arguments:
      {init,up,set,tag}
        init                Create new version file
        up                  Increase version
        set                 Set version to specified one
        tag                 Create VCS tag with current version

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      --file VERSION_FILE, -f VERSION_FILE
                            path to file where version is saved
      --version, -v         show program's version number and exit
      --date-format DATE_FORMAT
                            Date format used in project files
      --vcs-engine VCS_ENGINE
                            Select VCS engine (only git is supported currently)
      --vcs-commit-message VCS_COMMIT_MESSAGE, -m VCS_COMMIT_MESSAGE
                            Commit message used when committing changes
      --verbose             Be more verbose if it's possible

So, there are four commands: ``init``, ``up``, ``set`` and ``tag``. We
want to look at this:

::

    usage: ver init [-h] [--commit] [value]

    positional arguments:
      value         Initial version

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help    show this help message and exit
      --commit, -c  Commit changes done by `up` command (only if there is no
                    changes in repo before)

    usage: ver up [-h] [--commit] [--major | --minor | --patch] [value]

    positional arguments:
      value         Increase version by this value (default: 1)

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help    show this help message and exit
      --commit, -c  Commit changes done by `up` command (only if there is no
                    changes in repo before)
      --major, -j   increase major part of version
      --minor, -n   increase minor part of version (project default)
      --patch, -p   increase patch part of version

    % ver set --help
    usage: ver set [-h] [--major MAJOR] [--minor MINOR] [--patch PATCH]
                   [--prerelease PRERELEASE] [--build BUILD] [--commit]
                   [value]

    positional arguments:
      value                 set version to this value

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      --major MAJOR, -j MAJOR
                            set major part of version to MAJOR
      --minor MINOR, -n MINOR
                            set minor part of version to MINOR
      --patch PATCH, -p PATCH
                            set patch part of version to PATCH
      --prerelease PRERELEASE, -r PRERELEASE
                            set prerelease part of version to PRERELEASE
      --build BUILD, -b BUILD
                            set build part of version to BUILD
      --commit, -c          Commit changes done by `set` command (only if there is
                            no changes in repo before)
                            
    % ver tag --help
    usage: ver tag [-h] [--vcs-tag-param VCS_TAG_PARAMS]

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      --vcs-tag-param VCS_TAG_PARAMS
                            Additional params for VCS for "tag" command

Configuration
-------------

Configuration is both: user-wide and project-wide.

User-wide is stored in ``~/.versionner.rc`` file, and project-wide is
stored in ``<PROJECT_ROOT>/.versionner.rc``. Projects' configuration is
superior to user-wide.

It allows you also to modify other files specified in configuration.

``.versionner.rc`` is INI file in format:

::

    [versionner]
    file = ./VERSION
    date_format = %Y-%m-%d
    up_part = patch
    ;default_init_version = 1.0.0

    [vcs]
    engine = git
    commit_message = '%(version)s'
    ;tag_params =
    ;  -f
    ;  --local-user=some-key-id

    [file:some/folder/some_file.py]
    enabled = true
    search = ^\s*__version__\s*=.*$
    replace = __version__ = '%(version)s'
    date_format = %Y-%m-%d
    match = line
    search_flags = 
    encoding = utf-8

    [file:2:some/folder/some_file.py]
        enabled = true
        search = ^"Program is in version \d+\.\d+\.\d+"$
        replace = "Program is in version %(version)s"
        match = line
        search_flags = 
        encoding = utf-8

Data in '[project]' section are default data for whole project.

Data in '[file:some/folder/some\_file.py]' section are for single file
from project. You can specify here that file 'some/folder/some\_file.py'
have version string (key: ``enabled``), has encoding ``encoding`` and we
have to search for it (``search``) and replace it with value of
``replace``. If ``match`` is 'line', then ``search`` is matched line by
line, and for 'file' whole file is read into memory and matched against
``search``.

When replacing values, there can be used some of placeholders:

::

    %(date)s: current date
    %(major)s: major part of version
    %(minor)s: minor part of version
    %(patch)s: patch part of version
    %(prerelease)s: prerelease part of version
    %(build)s: build part of version
    %(version)s: full version string

If you must do more replaces in single file, just add number to section
name:

::

    [file:2:some/path]

Installation
------------

1. Using PIP

``versionner`` should work on any platform where
`Python <http://python.org>`__ is available, it means Linux, Windows,
MacOS X etc.

Simplest way is to use Python's built-in package system:

::

    pip3 install versionner

2. Using `pipsi <https://github.com/mitsuhiko/pipsi>`__

   pipsi install --python3 versionner

3. Using sources

Download sources from
`Github <https://github.com/msztolcman/versionner/archive/1.4.1.zip>`__:

    wget -O 1.4.1.zip https://github.com/msztolcman/versionner/archive/1.4.1.zip

or

::

    curl -o 1.4.1.zip https://github.com/msztolcman/versionner/archive/1.4.1.zip

Unpack:
