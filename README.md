versionner
==========

`versionner` helps manipulating version of the project.

With one command you can update all required files with new version.

Current stable version
----------------------

0.4.2

Features
--------

* `versionner` guards the compliance with [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/)
* manual changes are error-prone, `versionner` is error proof
* it's easier to write: `versionner up` instead of open editor, edit and
    save changes ;)
* `versionner` updates also project files (like README or sth)
* it's [very easy to install](#installation)

Some examples
-------------

Some examples:

    # initialise new file with version 0.1.0
    % versionner init
    
    # initialise new file with version 1.0.0
    % versionner init 1.0.0

    # prints current version info
    % versionner
    
    # increase minor by 1, set patch to 0
    versionner up
    
    # increase patch by 1
    versionner up --patch 
    
    # increase patch by 4
    versionner up --patch 4
     
    # just guess...
    versionner set --minor 3 --patch 2 --build asd3f
        
    # set version to 1.0.0
    versionner set 1.0.0

More
----

Everything is in help :) Just execute:

    versionner --help

Look at result:

    % versionner --help
    usage: versionner [-h] [--file VERSION_FILE] [--version]
                      [--date-format DATE_FORMAT]
                      {init,up,set} ...
    
    Manipulate version of project
    
    positional arguments:
      {init,up,set}
        init                Create new version file
        up                  Increase version
        set                 Set version to specified one
    
    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      --file VERSION_FILE, -f VERSION_FILE
                            path to file where version is saved
      --version, -v         show program's version number and exit
      --date-format DATE_FORMAT
                            Date format used in project files
      
So, there are three commands: `init`, `up` and `set`. We want to look at this:

    % versionner init --help
    usage: versionner init [-h] [value]
    
    positional arguments:
      value       Initial version
    
    optional arguments:
      -h, --help  show this help message and exit

    % versionner up --help
    usage: versionner up [-h] [--major | --minor | --patch] [value]
    
    positional arguments:
      value        Increase version by this value (default: 1)
    
    optional arguments:
      -h, --help   show this help message and exit
      --major, -j  increase major part of version
      --minor, -n  increase minor part of version (default)
      --patch, -p  increase patch part of version

    % versionner set --help
    usage: versionner set [-h] [--major MAJOR] [--minor MINOR] [--patch PATCH]
                          [--prerelease PRERELEASE] [--build BUILD]
                          [value]
    
    positional arguments:
      value                 set version to this value
    
    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      --major MAJOR, -j MAJOR
                            set major part of version to MAJOR
      --minor MINOR, -n MINOR
                            set minor part of version to MINOR
      --patch PATCH, -p PATCH
                            set patch part of version to PATCH
      --prerelease PRERELEASE, -r PRERELEASE
                            set prerelease part of version to PRERELEASE
      --build BUILD, -b BUILD
                            set build part of version to BUILD

Configuration
---------------------

Configuration is both: user-wide and project-wide.

User-wide is stored in `~/.versionner.rc` file, and project-wide is stored in
`<PROJECT_ROOT>/.versionner.rc`. Projects' configuration is superior to user-wide.

It allows you also to modify other files specified in configuration.

`.versionner.rc` is INI file in format:

    [versionner]
    file = ./VERSION
    date_format = %Y-%m-%d
    up_part = patch
    
    [file:some/folder/some_file.py]
    enabled = true
    search = ^\s*__version__\s*=.*$
    replace = __version__ = '%(version)s'
    date_format = %Y-%m-%d
    match = line
    search_flags = 
    encoding = utf-8

Data in '[project]' section are default data for whole project.

Data in '[file:some/folder/some_file.py]' section are for single file from
project. You can specify here that file 'some/folder/some_file.py' have
version string (key: `enabled`), has encoding `encoding` and we have to
search for it (`search`) and replace it with value of `replace`. If `match` is
'line', then `search` is matched line by line, and for 'file' whole file is
read into memory and matched against `search`.

Installation
------------

`versionner` should work on any platform where [Python](http://python.org)
is available, it means Linux, Windows, MacOS X etc. 

Simplest way is to use Python's built-in package system:

    pip install versionner

In other case, you can go also to [GitHub releases](https://github.com/mysz/versionner/releases),
download newest release, unpack and put somewhere in `PATH` (ie. `~/bin`
or `/usr/local/bin`).

If You want to install newest unstable version, then just copy file to your
PATH, for example:

    curl https://raw.github.com/mysz/versionner/master/versionner.py > /usr/local/bin/versionner

or:

    wget https://raw.github.com/mysz/versionner/master/versionner.py -O /usr/local/bin/versionner

Voila!
